# Pneumonia-detection-using-chest-xray
Deep neural networks to predict Pneumonia using chest xray

# Build an algorithm to detect pneumonia in medical images. Specifically, locate lung opacities on chest radiographs.

● Exploring the given Data files, classes and images of different classes.
● Dealing with missing values
● Visualisation of different classes
● Analysis from the visualisation of different classes.
● Building a pneumonia detection model starting from basic CNN and then improving upon itby using different models like VGG19, Chexnet, YOLO, basic CNN 
● Tuning different hyper parameters, by trying different optimizers, loss functions, epochs, learning rate, batch size, checkpointing, early stopping 
fine-tune them with Transfer learning
● Train the model,To deal with large training time, save the weights so that you can use them when training the model for the second time without starting from scratch
● Testing the model and checking the accuracy
